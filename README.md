# What was your Dissertation on ? [ChatGPT: The advancement of knowledge and incorporation for its users ](<CONL718 - Dissertation/CONL718 - Dissertation - Compiled Louis OthenFINAL.docx>)
This research investigates the use of ChatGPT from a user’s perspective. The aim of this study is to understand whether users perceive ChatGPT as helpful in enhancing their knowledge and, if so, whether it has been incorporated as a tool for day-to-day knowledge acquisition. This study employs a quantitative approach, using a created online survey provided to willing participants, to collect data from these survey submissions. The collected data was analysed and measured against the research questions and hypotheses.

## Research Questions
- RQ1. Is ChatGPT being used by participant?
- RQ2. If ChatGPT is being used by the participant, did the use of it enhance a user’s knowledge?
- RQ3. If ChatGPT did enhance a user's knowledge, has ChatGPT been adopted by the user for routine knowledge acquisition?

## Research Hypotheses
- RH1. “The utilization of ChatGPT increases the likelihood of enhancing a user's knowledge on a specific topic.”
- RH2. “Users who perceive ChatGPT as enhancing their knowledge are more likely to incorporate ChatGPT into their routine for knowledge acquisition compared to those who do not perceive ChatGPT as enhancing their knowledge.”

# What Grade did I get?
Distinction! I am really pleased with my result, considering I was working full time as a Data Scientist contractor, suffering a cancer scare and a relationship breakdown all whilst doing this degree. With all that in mind it made me realise, that I am capable, resillient and can do some wonderful things, even with negative pressures.
